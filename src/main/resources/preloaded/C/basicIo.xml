    There are several input and output throughputs in a C program.
    However, for this cheatsheet we will cover the basics, that is the standard input output

    stdout : Standard Output
    stdin : Standard Input
    stderr : Standard error

    For C, there are there basic input and output methods.
    1.  getchar() and putchar() function
        getchar() function will return a char from the user input.
        ```
        char c = getchar();
        ```

        putchar() function will print a character into the screen.
        ```
        puthcar(c); // ths function will print c to the monitor
        ```
    2.  printf() and scanf() function
        printf function will print the content inside the brackets
        ```
        int a = 5;
        char b = 'b';
        float c = 5.85;
        printf("The value of a=%d, b=%c, c=%f ",a,b,c);
        ```
        scanf function will take in the user input from the keyboard and puts it into an address
        ```
        scanf("%d, &amp;a)
        scanf("%c, &amp;b)
        scanf("%f, &amp;c);
        ```
        In the scanf and printf function, you need to specify the datatype of variables you want to print.
        %d denotes an int
        $c denotes a char
        %f denotes a float (%n.mf -> n denotes the number of characters, m denotes how many decimal points in the number)

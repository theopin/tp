    C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.

    C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.

    Sr.No.	Statement &amp; Description
        1	if statement
            An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.

        2	if...else statement
            An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.

        3	nested if statements
            You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).

        4	switch statement
            A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

        5	nested switch statements
            You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).

    The ? : Operator
        The conditional operator ? : can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form
        ```
        Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
        ```
        Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
        The value of a ? expression is determined like this âˆ’

        Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.

        If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

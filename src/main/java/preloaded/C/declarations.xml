    There are ways to declare the variables in  C program.
    Declarations in C can be made by typing the datatype and the variable name.
    The datatype of the variable must be a valid datatype, including char, int, double, or other user defined variables.

    data_type variable_name

    For example, to declare an integer you can do:
    ```
    int numberOne;
    ```

    During your declaration, you can also put in the initial value (initialize) of the variable.
    ```
    int numberOne = 1;
    ```
    In a C program, a variable must be declared at the top of the program.
    This is to allocate specific amount of memory for the program.

Programming Language: C
Contents:
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.

C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.

Sr.No.	Statement & Description
    1	if statement
        An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.

    2	if...else statement
        An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.

    3	nested if statements
        You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).

    4	switch statement
        A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

    5	nested switch statements
        You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).

The ? : Operator
    The conditional operator ? : can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form
    ```
    Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
    ```
    Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
    The value of a ? expression is determined like this −

    Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.

    If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

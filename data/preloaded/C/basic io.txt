Programming Language: C

There are several input and output throughputs in a C program.
However, for this cheatsheet we will cover the basics, that is the standard input output

stdout : Standard Output
stdin : Standard Input
stderr : Standard error

For C, there are there basic input and output methods.
1.  getchar() and putchar() function
    getchar() function will return a char from the user input.
    ```
    char c = getchar();
    ```

    putchar() function will print a character into the screen.
    ```
    puthcar(c); // ths function will print c to the monitor
    ```
2.  printf() and scanf() function
    printf function will print the content inside the brackets
    ```
    int a = 5;
    char b = 'b';
    float c = 5.85;
    printf("The value of a=%d, b=%c, c=%f ",a,b,c);
    ```
    scanf function will take in the user input from the keyboard and puts it into an address
    ```
    scanf("%d, &a)
    scanf("%c, &b)
    scanf("%f, &c);
    ```
    In the scanf and printf function, you need to specify the datatype of variables you want to print.
    %d denotes an int
    $c denotes a char
    %f denotes a float (%n.mf -> n denotes the number of characters, m denotes how many decimal points in the number)

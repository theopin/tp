Programming Language: C

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages −

Loop Architecture
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.

Sr.No.	Loop Type & Description
    1	while loop
        Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

    2	for loop
        Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

    3	do...while loop
        It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.

    4	nested loops
        You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.

Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

C supports the following control statements.

Sr.No.	Control Statement & Description
1	break statement
    Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.

2	continue statement
    Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.

3	goto statement
    Transfers control to the labeled statement.

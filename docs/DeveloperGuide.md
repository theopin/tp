<a id="introduction"></a>
# 1. Introduction<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

The motivation behind CheatLogs is to reduce the time spent to scroll through pages of stack overflow posts or online documentation sites to find a syntax for a programming language, which is very common for novice programmers. 

**CheatLogs** allows it's user to access cheat sheets and notes for various programming syntax and functions. This gives novice programmers a way faster to get references as they build their applications. It also provides a set of preloaded cheatsheets for common languages novice programmers adopt. It consists of both a command line interface and a graphical user interface. Below is a summary of all the commands.

To cheatsheets in the list of cheatsheets:  `add`, `delete`, or`clear` 

To modify properties of a specific cheatsheet: `edit` or `favorite`.

To get specific cheatsheets:  `find`, `view`  and `list`

To use more general commands:  `help` , `set`, `exit`

<a id="design"></a>
# 4. Design<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

This section will elaborate on the architecture and component design of CheatLogs.


<a id="architecture"></a>
## 4.1. Architecture<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

The image below illustrates the high-level design of CheatLogs.

![](Images/Image3.PNG)

Image 1: General Architecture of CheatLogs

CheatLogs is split into 5 major components, each handling distinct features of the application. The components and a brief description of them is listed below.
* `UI`: The user interface of the app.
* `CheatSheet`: The structure of each cheat sheet
* `CheatSheetList`: A collection of every cheat sheet.
* `Parser`: Builds a data structure based on user inputs.
* `Command`: An encapsulation of data and methods to execute each command
* `Storage`: Updates application data based on relevant external files.

The UML diagram below illustrates an extensive version of the various classes present in CheatLogs as well as their interactions with each other.


![](https://i.ibb.co/Cb8GckB/image.png)

Image 2: In-Depth Architecture of CheatLogs

For each component, it can be further split into different classes which have a unique responsibility. They will be further elaborated upon in the next section.


<a id="components"></a>
## 4.2. Components<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

This application contains five different components. 
Each component has a unique function and contributes to the functionality of this application.

---

<a id="user-interface"></a>
### 4.2.1. User Interface<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>
//Abner
This component handles interactions with the user and manages the input and output of the programme. 

![](Images/Image5.PNG)

Image 3: User Session class fields and methods

One of the classes is UserSession which contains the main loop of the program. 
Every loop it reads and parses the user input to get a Command object which encapsulates all the necessary information needed to execute the command. 
After execution, it handles potential exceptions thrown.


A single instance of common objects are usually created in UserSession, such as Ui and Printer objects. 
These common objects are injected into other objects that need them via the class constructor instead of static methods.
The common objects include the Ui and  Printer helper classes which provide an organized way to read and write data. 
Most of the programmes’ output is made via calls to the same common printer object.

<a id="command-parser"></a>
### 4.2.2. Command Parser<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>
//Brandon
This component would parse the user input to produce useful information which would be used to construct a Command and executed the command. 

![](Images/Image6.PNG)

Image 4: Interaction between components to parse and execute command

![](Images/Image7.PNG)

Image 5: Sequence Diagram from parsing input to command execution

Image 4 and 5 illustrates the interactions between Parser, CommandExecutor and Command when a user inputs an instruction. 

The steps below explain the sequence diagram:
1. User input an instruction
2. A new Parser object is created
3. Parser#parse() is called to extract command type, name, programming language and details from the user-inputted instruction
4. If the user input is valid, a new CommandExecutor object would be created
5. CommandExecutor#execute() would be called to create a new Command object according to type of command user inputted
6. Command#execute() would call other methods from CheatSheet and CheatSheetList to carry out specific instructions.


<a id="command"></a>
### 4.2.3. Commands	<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>
All commands in CheatLogs inherit from an abstract `Command` class. Furthermore, classes which accept `NAME` or `INDEX` as its flag inherit from a sub-class of `Command` class, namely the `FinderCommand` class.

Below is the class diagram for the command package.

![image](https://i.ibb.co/phXS1Z6/image.png)

<a id="findercommand"></a>
##### 4.2.3.1 FinderCommand
`FinderCommand` provides the capability to search for the desired cheatsheet using the `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method. Upon method calls, the sub-class of `FinderCommand` will first call this method to get the desired cheatsheet, then it proceeds to process this cheatsheet object based on its own functionality. A sequence diagram will be given for each commands to better illustrate the interaction between this class with its sub-classes.

<a id="add"></a>
##### 4.2.3.1 Add
The AddCommand is used to add cheatsheets into CheatLogs.
The picture bellow shows how the AddCommand is executed.
![AddCommand Sequence Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/GtFKP7V/Add-Command-4.png)
1. When the AddCommand.execute()is called, it will self-invoke the `get(CommandFlag.NAME)` and will return `name`
2. After that, the add command self-invoke the `get(CommandFlag.SUBJECT)` and returns the `subject`
3. Add command will invoke the `callContentEditor()` within its class.
4. The callContent Editor will execute the `editor.setEditingContent(name,subject)`method followed by `editor.open()`
5. The program will wait for the editor in the `editor.waitForClose()` to close and will return the control to the AddCommand class.
6. The program will give back control to the `AddCommand` object, and will call the `editor.getContent()` to get the description from the Editor.
7. The AddCommand will construct a CheatSheet object using `CheatSheet(name,subject,description)`
8. After the CheatSheet object is constructed, it will be added to the CheatSheetList using `cheatSheetList.add(cheatSheet)` method.
9. Finally, once the cheatSheet has been added into the cheatSheetList, the AddCommand will invoke the `printAddNewCheatSheetMessage(cheatSheet,cheatSheetList)` to print the confirmation message.

<a id="edit"></a>
##### 4.2.3.2 Edit
The edit command allows the user to edit the content of the CheatSheet object.
The image bellow is how the EditCommand is executed.
![EditCommand Sequence Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/tPg1pjL/Edit-Command-4.png)
1. When the `EditCommand.execute()` method is called, it self-invoke the `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method
2. Inside the `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method, it will self-invoke the `flagToDescription.get(CommandFlag.NAME)` to retrieve the cheatsheet name.
3. The program execution continues by self-invoking the `flagToDescription.get(CommandFlag.INDEX)` to retrieve the cheatSheet index.
4. The program will get the cheatsheet from the CheatSheetList object with either the name using `get(name)` or index `get(index)` of the cheatsheet.
5. The `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method will return the `desiredCheatSheet`
6. After that, the EditCommand will invoke the `callContentEditor(cheatSheet)` to show the content editor.
7. Inside the `callContentEditor(cheatSheet)` method, it will call the `editor.open` method (to open the editor). 
8. After that, the content of the cheatsheet will be set inside the text editor when editor.setContent(desiredCheatSheet) method is called.
9. The program will wait for the editor to close when the `editor.waitForClose()` is called.
10. To reflect the change, the EditCommand object will invoke `cheatsheet.setDetail(editor.getContent())` method to get the content of the cheatsheet and also change the content of the cheatsheet.

<a id="view"></a>
##### 4.2.3.3 View
The view command is used to view the content of the cheatsheet in tht command line interface.
The sequence diagram bellow demonstrates how tht view command is executed.
![ViewCommand_Sequence_Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/GF4LZYy/View-Command-3.png)
1. When the `ViewCommand.execute()` method is called, it self-invoke the `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method
2. Inside the `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method, it will self-invoke the `flagToDescription.get(CommandFlag.NAME)` to retrieve the cheatsheet name.
3. The program execution continues by self-invoking the `flagToDescription.get(CommandFlag.INDEX)` to retrieve the cheatSheet index.
4. The program will get the cheatsheet from the CheatSheetList object with either the name using `get(name)` or index `get(index)` of the cheatsheet.
5. The `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method will return the `desiredCheatSheet`
6. Afterwards, it will call the `printViewCheatSheetMessage` of the printer class to print the cheatsheet into the command line.

<a id="exit"></a>
##### 4.2.3.4 Exit
The exit command is used to exit the CheatLogs program.
The sequence digaram bellow will demonstrate how it is executed.
![ExitCommand_Sequence-Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/4SxcnL5/Exit-Command-1.png)
1. When a user type /exitThe ExitCommand is constructed.
2. It will invoke the execute() method which will set the isExitCommand to true.

<a id="list"></a>
##### 4.2.3.6 List

<a id="find"></a>
##### 4.2.3.7 Find

<a id="setting"></a>
##### 4.2.3.8 Setting 

<a id="delete"></a>
##### 3.2.3.9 Delete
Delete command removes one cheatsheet from the CheatSheetList and deletes the corresponding file in the */data* directory.

Here is an example of the usage of `/delete` command and how it works:
1. User type `/delete /i 1` to delete all cheatsheets. `UserSession` class reads the input and passes this to the `Parser` class.
2. The parser parses the user command which results in a `DeleteCommand` object.
3. This object is passed back to `UserSession` class and it calls `DeleteCommand.execute()`.
4. `DeleteCommand.execute()` invokes `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method from the `FinderCommand` class to find the desired cheatsheet. If the cheatsheet does not exist, it throws an exception.
5. Then, it asks the user's confirmation through `printer.printDeleteConfirmation()`.
6. If the user says yes, it invokes the `fileDestroyer.executeFunction(cheatSheetToDelete.getName())` to delete the corresponding file in the */data* directory. 
7. Next, it invokes `cheatSheetList.remove(cheatSheetToDelete.getName())` to delete the cheatsheet from CheatSheetList.
8. Lastly, it calls `printer.printDeleteCheatSheetMessage` to give feedback message to the user.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how steps 4 - 8 are executed by DeleteCommand.
![](https://i.ibb.co/BGgTVgb/image.png)
<a id="clear"></a>
##### 4.2.3.10 Clear
Clear command deletes all user-defined cheatsheets while maintaining the preloaded cheatsheets.

Here is an example of the usage of `/clear` command and how it works:
1. User type `/clear` to delete all cheatsheets. `UserSession` class reads the input and passes this to the `Parser` class.
2. The parser parses the user command which results in a `ClearCommand` object.
3. This object is passed back to `UserSession` class and it calls `ClearCommand.execute()`.
4. `ClearCommand.execute()` first asks the user for confirmation by calling `printer.printClearConfirmation()`. If the user confirms, it invokes the `fileDestroyer.executeFunction()` to delete all user-defined cheatsheets stored in the */data* directory.
5. Subsequently, it invokes the `cheatSheetList.clear()` to delete all cheatsheets in the CheatSheetList.
6. Next, it invokes `fileReader.extractPreloadedCheatSheets()` and `fileReader.executeFunction()` to restore the preloaded cheatsheets.
7. Lastly, it calls `printer.printClearCheatSheetMessage` to give feedback message to the user.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how steps 4 - 7 are executed by ClearCommand.

![](https://i.ibb.co/CVRZ9dZ/image.png)

<a id="favourite"></a>
##### 4.2.3.11 Favourite
Favourite command adds/removes the cheatsheet from/to favourites.

Here is an example of the usage of `/fav` command and how it works:
1. User type `/fav /i 1` to add the first cheatsheet to favourites. `UserSession` class reads the input and passes this to the `Parser` class.
2. The parser parses the user command which results in a `FavouriteCommand` object.
3. This object is passed back to `UserSession` class and it calls `FavouriteCommand.execute()`.
4. `FavouriteCommand.execute()` invokes `getCheatSheetFromNameOrIndex()` method from the `FinderCommand` class to find the desired cheatsheet. If the cheatsheet does not exist, it throws an exception.
5. Next, it checks the existence of the delete flag `/d` and invokes `cheatSheetToFavourite.setFavourite(isAddFav)` to add/remove the cheatsheet to/from favourites based on the existence of the delete flag.
6. Lastly, it calls `printer.printFavouritedCheatSheetMessage` to give feedback message to the user.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how steps 4 - 6 are executed by FavouriteCommand.
![](https://i.ibb.co/zszqCSf/image.png)
<a id="help"></a>
##### 4.2.3.12 Help
Help command prints the descriptions and examples for all commands.

Here is an example of the usage of `/help` command and how it works:
1. User type `/fav /i 1` to add the first cheatsheet to favourites. `UserSession` class reads the input and passes this to the `Parser` class.
2. The parser parses the user command which results in a `FavouriteCommand` object.
3. This object is passed back to `UserSession` class and it calls `HelpCommand.execute()`.
4. `HelpCommand.execute()` invokes `printer.printHelpSheet()` method and it prints the help sheet to the user.
The following sequence diagram illustrates how step 4 is executed by HelpCommand.
![](https://i.ibb.co/zmGSZhG/image.png)
<a id="cheat-sheet-structure"></a>
#### 4.2.4. Cheat Sheet Structure <font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>
//Aldo

To further understand our cheatsheet management application, it is important to understand the inner workings of the CheatSheet class. 
CheatLogs comes with preloaded cheat sheets and the application has an in-built ability for the user to add, edit, and delete their own cheat sheets. 
The preloaded cheat sheet cannot be modified by the user, as the user-made cheatsheet is able to be modified by the user.


The CheatSheet class is the class that models the cheat sheet that we used in our program. 
Each of our cheatsheet object is intended to store one cheatsheet topic for one specific programming language (both preloaded and user-created cheat sheets).

This system is intended to increase user access and organization of the cheat sheets.
Each of the CheatSheet object has:
1. 	Name
2. 	Programming Language
3. 	Description (Content of the cheatsheet)
4. 	isFavorite
5. 	isModifiable
6. 	Date Created
7. 	Date Modified

<a id="cheat-sheet-management"></a>
### 4.2.5. Cheat Sheet Management<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

All cheat sheets, both pre-loaded and user-defined, are stored in a class called `CheatSheetList` during runtime. Here is a class diagram to illustrate the relation between CheatSheet and CheatSheetList.

![](https://i.ibb.co/t3gR5RV/image.png)

Upon receiving a valid input from the user, the `execute()` method from `Command` class will invoke the mutation of `CheatSheetList`, 
and then `DataFileWriter` will use the information in `CheatSheetList` to save it to the memory in the form of a `xml` file.

The cheatSheets ArrayList is of type private, and setter/getter methods must be invoked to access the list. 
For these setter and getter methods, it accepts both accessing by its index and accessing by its name to allow the user to easily search and fetch the cheat sheet.
Here is the list of `Commands` that invokes a method call of CheatSheetList:
- `/add`
- `/clear`
- `/delete`
- `/edit`
- `/fav`
- `/find`
- `/list`
- `/view`

<a id="data-storage"></a>
### 4.2.6. Data Storage<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>
//Theo
This feature allows the application to read and update data in the form of text files. 
Having an external source to store data will allow the application to be able to retrieve it when it is relaunched at another instance. 
This prevents the user from having to repeatedly create new cheatsheets and update the application settings each time he opens up CheatLogs. 

The following UML diagram illustrates the major interactions between the classes present in the 
*storage* package. 

[!Image]()

As we can see from the diagram above, the following 3 classes are subclasses of the *DataFile* class.
* *DataFileReader*
* *DataFileWriter*
* *DataFileDestroyer*

<a id="file-writer"></a>
## 4.2.6.1 Writing files<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

Whenever you give a command to *add* or *edit* a cheatsheet, this feature will be activated. Through this
feature, CheatLogs will attempt to update all cheatsheet files, creating a new cheat sheet file if a new 
cheat sheet is created. To ensure that your cheat sheet files

<a id="file-writer-design"></a>
#### 4.2.6.2 Writing files<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

Whenever you give a command to *add* or *edit* a cheatsheet, this feature will be activated. Through this
feature, CheatLogs will attempt to update all cheatsheet files, creating a new cheat sheet file if a new 
cheat sheet is created. To ensure that your cheat sheet files

<a id="file-reader-design"></a>
#### 4.2.6.2 Reading files<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

When CheatLogs is launched, it attempts to parse all XML files present in the /data directory and
use it to create individual cheat sheets for each file. In the event that a particular XML file 
cannot be read, it will be skipped to ensure that other files can be converted into cheat sheets.


<a id="file-destroyer-design"></a>
#### 4.2.6.3 Deleting files<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

When you decide to remove a cheat sheet, CheatLogs will delete the relevant cheat sheet files immediately. After this 
operation, it will perform a search through the /data directory and delete any subdirectories without any cheat sheet.
This ensures that your /data file is not cluttered with empty directories.

<br>

<a id="implementation"></a>
# 5. Implementation<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


<a id="parsing-of-data-to-construct-commands"></a>
## 5.1. Parsing of Data to Construct Commands<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

The command classes follow the command pattern. 
During construction in Parser.parse() they get the information they need to execute from parsed data based on the user input. 
Flags in the input are used to separate the different information. (e.g. `/add /n if /l python /k is nice`, has 3 flags, /n /l and /k and the String “python" is associated with the flag /l). 
This information is stored in a HashMap where the descriptor (defined in ArgumentEnum) of the flag is the key and the information associated with it is the value.
The command can execute at a random time later via commandObj.execute().12


<a id="editing-feature"></a>
## 5.2. Editing Feauture<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

The editing feature is enabled using a simple text editor that uses a graphical user interface. 
The strong reason that we wanted to use a GUI is that it offers more flexibility and editing power for the user rather than just using command-line editing methods.


The editing feature is handled by the TextEditor class. The Text Editor inherits from JFrame and implements the Action Listener class. 
The text editor is instantiated when the edit command is invoked. 


<a id="sorting-feature"></a>
## 5.3. Sorting Feature<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

This feature allows cheat sheets to be sorted in ascending or descending order according to the name or programming language of the cheat sheet.


This feature is facilitated by ListCommand class. 
It made use of Collections.sort along with sortByName and SortByLanguage which both implements Comparator<CheatSheet>. 


Collections and Comparator forms the private method askForSortingConfigAndPrint(). 
The inclusion of the method allows the user to choose the sorting option and the sorted cheat sheets will be printed.	


Alternative: Using a for loop to sort by name and another loop that sorts by language
Con: There would be many duplicate code and not good for reusability. 
By using the sort() method present in java. util. Collections class, we would have better flexibility as the sort method could be reused with different functions just by including a new class that implements comparable.


<a id="data-storage"></a>
## 5.4. Data storage<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

This feature stores cheat sheets on the hard-drive in the form of XML file. 
When the application loads subsequently, data from these files will be converted and loaded into the application.

<a id="file-writer"></a>
### 5.4.1 Writing files<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

Whenever you give a command to *add* or *edit* a cheatsheet, this feature will be activated. Through this
feature, CheatLogs will attempt to update all cheatsheet files, creating a new cheat sheet file if a new 
cheat sheet is created. To ensure that your cheat sheet files


<a id="file-reader"></a>
### 5.4.2 Reading files<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

When CheatLogs is launched, it attempts to parse all XML files present in the /data directory and
use it to create individual cheat sheets for each file. In the event that a particular XML file 
cannot be read, it will be skipped to ensure that other files can be converted into cheat sheets.

### 5.4.3 Deleting files<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

When you decide to remove a cheat sheet, CheatLogs will delete the relevant cheat sheet files immediately. After this 
operation, it will perform a search through the /data directory and delete any subdirectories without any cheat sheet.
This ensures that your /data file is not cluttered with empty directories.


<a id="settings-implementation"></a>
## 5.5. Changing default settings<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>

Settings class allows users to customize the application to fit their preference. The user can change the color scheme of the output and also change the behavior of help messages attached to each command. 
The reason we chose color scheme and help messages to be customizable are as follows:
1. The color scheme of the terminal for each system may differ. The might be scenarios where the color scheme of the terminal and the application does not match and the text became not readable.
2. The help messages are designed to help new users familiarize themselves with the commands available in CheatLogs. For more experienced users who are already familiar with all the commands, these help messages can be removed.

Design consideration:
Alternative 1 (current choice): Saves the file using a txt file
* Pros: The txt file is simple and the parser used does not interfere with the one used to parse the cheatsheets
* Cons: Needs to create another parser for the settings file

Alternative 2: Uses xml file to save the settings
* Pros: Standardizes the save file to xml for both cheatsheets and settings file
* Cons: Needs to tamper with the existing cheatsheet parsers and not very straightforward to implement

<a id="colour-coding-for-code-snippet"></a>
## 5.6. \[Proposed\] Colour coding for code snippet<font size="5"> [:arrow_up_small:](#table-of-contents)</font>
The idea of this feature is to improve the readability of the code snippets (if present) inside the cheat sheet. 
To make this possible, several adjustments must be made to the save data format to allow more information to be stored inside a single file instead of scattered across multiple files. 
Thus, instead of saving to a txt file, the program will write the cheat sheet data into a xml file, for easier parsing and sectioning. 


Given below is an example to illustrate the mechanism.
1. The user launches the application and will be prompted to enter a command
2. The user chooses the /add command, and will be prompted to fill three fields: name, programming language, and details
3. When filling the details, a text editor will pop up. The user now can add their cheat sheet inside this field and he/she can indicate the sections of the cheatsheet using tags similar to markdown
4. The DataFileParser will parse the sections and store the information inside a xml file, with a different tag for each section
5. When the user invokes the /view command, the Printer class will interpret these tags and prepend and append ANSI escape codes to the text


Design consideration:
Alternative 1 (current choice): Saves the file using a xml file, with different tags for each section
* Pros: Allows to store all data in a single file
* Cons: The parsing and saving to the xml file is quite complicated


Alternative 2: Save different sections of the cheat sheet using a different file, and store the files in a folder according to its language
* Pros: The implementation of the parser and file writer is much easier
* Cons: Sections of a single cheatsheet is scattered across multiple files

## Overview
CheatLogs is a desktop application used for managing a user's cheatsheets. 
The user interacts with it using a command line interface (CLI), 
and it has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaSwing. 
It is written in Java and has about 5000 Lines of Code (LoC).

### New Features

* Read cheatsheets from `.xml` files
  * Allows the user to load cheatsheets that were previously created.
  * This feature enhances the product as it prevents the user from having
    to type his cheatsheets everytime CheatLogs is loaded.
  * This implementation was difficult as it involved creating strong links
    to the main features of CheatLogs.
  * It was also a tough feature to implement as it involved creating various
    levels of checks to defend areas that users could exploit to crash
    the program.
    
* Write cheatsheets to `.xml` files
  * Allows the user to store cheatsheets that were created in a session of
    CheatLogs.
  * This feature enhances the product as it allows the user to store his
    cheatsheets in a file, which can be read by the application in a 
    subsequent run.
  * This implementation involved creating a proper structure for the `.xml` 
    file so that it can be properly parsed when the application loads 
    subsequently.
  * This feature was difficult as it involved constantly identifying whether
    the cheatsheet was preloaded or not. Such identification is essential to 
    ensuring that it is sorted into the correct directory. 
      
* Delete `.xml` files from storage
  * Allows the user to remove any cheat sheet.
  * This feature enhances the product as it allows the user to better 
    organize his present cheat sheets by removing cheatsheets he does not
    want to reference anymore. Moreover, it provides an option for the user
    to clean all his stored cheatsheets if he feels that they are 
    unnecessary.
  * This implementation was difficult as it involved deleting both the file
    and its parent directory if it was empty. A systematic system had to be 
    implemented that looks out for any empty directories to reduce clutter
    in the user directory.  
      
* Preloaded cheatsheets
  * Allows `.xml` files containing example cheatsheets to be packaged within
    the `.jar` file.
  * This feature enhances the product as it prevents the user from having
    to type his cheatsheets everytime CheatLogs is loaded.
  * This implementation was difficult as it involved parsing the required files
    from within the packaged `.jar` file. To locate these files, the method 
    used to locate files within the user directory was not effective, and I had
    to look up relevant Java libraries for features that could solve this 
    problem.
